## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Clone this beast
git clone https://github.com/wtrout187/task-manager.git

# Install dependencies like a pro
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch the system
python hqtest.py

🎮 Usage

# Create a new task
task = Task("Conquer the world", due_date=tomorrow, priority="High")

# Add subtasks
task.add_subtask("Take over North America")
task.add_subtask("Dominate Europe")

# Track progress
task.update_progress(50)  # 50% complete

Geographic Operations
# Add location-based task
task.set_location("Tokyo, Japan")
task.visualize_on_map()

🔧 Advanced Configuration
# Custom department configuration
DEPARTMENTS = [
    "IT", "PRODUCT MANAGEMENT", "ENGINEERING",
    "PROCUREMENT", "HR", "FINANCE", "OPERATIONS",
    "SALES", "MARKETING"
]

# Task priority levels
PRIORITIES = ["Low", "Normal", "High"]
